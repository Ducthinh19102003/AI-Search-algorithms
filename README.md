# **Solving problems by searching**

Here is my implementation of some basic search algorithms in AI, in which we have a planning agent who look ahead and find a sequence of actions that lead to the goal state. The search algorithms can be visualized through the game environment.

Core algorithm implementation:
   - `a_star_search.py`
   - `brfs_search.py`
   - `eval_function.results.md`
   - `heuristics.py`
   - `ids_search.py`
   - `minimax&expectimax_agent.py`
